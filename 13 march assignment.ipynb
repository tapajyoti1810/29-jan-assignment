    " Analysis of Variance (ANOVA) is a statistical method used to compare means across different groups or treatments. However, \n",

    "\n",
    "Assumptions required to use ANOVA:\n",
    "\n",
    "    1.Independence: The observations must be independent of each other. This means that the values of one observation should\n",
    "    not influence the values of another observation.\n",
    "\n",
    "    2.Normality: The distribution of the residuals (the differences between the observed values and the predicted values) \n",
    "    should be normally distributed. This assumption can be checked using a normal probability plot or a histogram of the \n",
    "    residuals.\n",
    "\n",
    "    3.Homogeneity of variance: The variance of the residuals should be the same across all levels of the independent variable.\n",
    "    This assumption can be checked using a plot of the residuals versus the predicted values or the independent variable.\n",
    "\n",
    "Examples of violations that could impact the validity of the results:\n",
    "\n",
    "    1.Violation of independence: If the observations are not independent of each other, then the ANOVA results may be biased.\n",
    "    For example, if there are repeated measures on the same subjects, then the observations are not independent. In such a \n",
    "    case, a repeated measures ANOVA may be more appropriate.\n",
    "\n",
    "    2.Violation of normality: If the residuals are not normally distributed, then the ANOVA results may be biased. For\n",
    "    example, if the residuals are skewed or have heavy tails, then the ANOVA results may be affected. In such a case, a \n",
    "    non-parametric test such as the Kruskal-Wallis test may be more appropriate.\n",
    "\n",
    "    3.Violation of homogeneity of variance: If the variance of the residuals is not the same across all levels of the \n",
    "    independent variable, then the ANOVA results may be biased. For example, if the variance of the residuals increases with\n",
    "    the level of the independent variable, then the ANOVA results may be affected. In such a case, a Welch's ANOVA or a \n",
    "    non-parametric test such as the Brown-Forsythe test may be more appropriate.\n",
