    "  The filter method is a feature selection technique that selects features based on their individual statistical properties,\n",

    "    specific machine learning model and is generally considered a pre-processing step in the machine learning pipeline.\n",
    "\n",
    "The filter method works by ranking the features according to a statistical metric and selecting a subset of features that meet\n",
    "a certain threshold. Some common statistical metrics used in the filter method include correlation coefficients, mutual \n",
    "information, and variance thresholds. The chosen threshold for the statistical metric depends on the problem at hand and the \n",
    "desired number of features to select.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, in a classification problem, we can use the correlation coefficient to measure the strength of the linear \n",
