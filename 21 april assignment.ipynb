    "The main difference between the Euclidean distance metric and the Manhattan distance metric in K-nearest neighbors (KNN) lies in the way they \n",
    "measure the distance or dissimilarity between data points. This difference can have an impact on the performance of a KNN classifier or\n",
    "regressor. Here's a breakdown of the differences and their effects:\n",
    "\n",
    "Euclidean Distance:\n",
    "\n",
    "Definition: Euclidean distance is calculated as the straight-line distance between two points in a Euclidean space. It measures the length of\n",
    "the direct path between two points.\n",
    "Formula: For two points (x₁, y₁) and (x₂, y₂) in a 2D space, the Euclidean distance is given by √((x₂ - x₁)² + (y₂ - y₁)²).\n",
    "Characteristics: Euclidean distance takes into account both the magnitude and direction of the differences between coordinates. It treats all\n",
    "dimensions equally and assumes that the relationship between features is isotropic (uniform in all directions).\n",
    "Impact on KNN: Euclidean distance tends to work well when the underlying data distribution is spherical or isotropic. It is more sensitive to \n",
    "changes in feature magnitudes and can be affected by features with larger scales dominating the distance calculations. Therefore, feature\n",
    "scaling is important when using Euclidean distance in KNN to ensure fair comparisons between features.\n",
    "Manhattan Distance:\n",
    "\n",
    "Definition: Manhattan distance, also known as city block distance or L1 distance, measures the sum of absolute differences between corresponding \n",
    "coordinates of two points. It measures the distance traveled along the axes to reach from one point to another, forming a path similar to\n",
    "moving through city blocks.\n",
    "Formula: For two points (x₁, y₁) and (x₂, y₂) in a 2D space, the Manhattan distance is given by |x₂ - x₁| + |y₂ - y₁|.\n",
    "Characteristics: Manhattan distance considers only the magnitude of differences between coordinates, ignoring the direction. It assumes\n",
    "movement is restricted to axis-aligned paths and does not account for diagonal movements.\n",
    "Impact on KNN: Manhattan distance is useful when the relationship between features is better captured by axis-aligned paths, such as in\n",
    "grid-like structures. It is less sensitive to changes in feature scales compared to Euclidean distance. However, it can be affected by \n",
    "differences in feature ranges, and features with larger ranges may dominate the distance calculations. Feature scaling can still be beneficial \n",
