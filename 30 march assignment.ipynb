    " Elastic Net Regression is a type of linear regression that combines the properties of both Lasso and Ridge regression \n",

    "Elastic Net Regression addresses this problem by adding a penalty term to the OLS cost function, which consists of both L1 \n",

    " Choosing the optimal values of the regularization parameters for Elastic Net Regression involves a trade-off between bias \n",
    "    and variance. The regularization parameters control the strength of the L1 and L2 penalties, which affect the complexity \n",
    "    of the model and the extent to which the coefficients are shrunk towards zero.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here are some common methods for choosing the optimal values of the regularization parameters:\n",
    "\n",
    "1.Cross-validation: One common approach is to use cross-validation, where the data is split into training and validation sets,\n",
    "and the model is trained on the training set using different values of the regularization parameters. The performance of the\n",
    "model is then evaluated on the validation set using a chosen metric, such as mean squared error (MSE) or mean absolute error \n",
    "(MAE). The values of the regularization parameters that produce the best performance on the validation set are selected as the\n",
    "optimal values.\n",
    "\n",
    "2.Grid Search: Another approach is to perform a grid search over a range of values for the regularization parameters. The grid\n",
    "search involves specifying a range of values for both the L1 and L2 penalties and then evaluating the model's performance on a\n",
    "validation set for each combination of values. The combination of values that produces the best performance is selected as the\n",
    "optimal values.\n",
    "\n",
    "3.Random Search: Similar to grid search, random search involves specifying a range of values for the regularization \n",
    "parameters, but instead of evaluating all possible combinations, random combinations of values are selected and evaluated on a\n",
    "validation set. This approach can be more efficient than grid search, especially when the range of values is large.\n",
    "\n",
    "4.Information Criteria: Information criteria such as Akaike Information Criterion (AIC) and Bayesian Information Criterion \n",
    "(BIC) can also be used to select the optimal values of the regularization parameters. These criteria balance the goodness of\n",
    "fit with the complexity of the model, and the optimal values are those that minimize the criterion.\n",
    "\n",
    "Overall, cross-validation is a widely used method for choosing the optimal values of the regularization parameters for Elastic\n",

    "\n",
    "1.Handles collinearity well: Elastic Net Regression is effective in dealing with collinearity, which occurs when the \n",
    "predictors in a regression model are highly correlated with each other. The L1 penalty in Elastic Net Regression encourages\n",

    "\n",
    "2.Less interpretable: The L1 and L2 penalties used in Elastic Net Regression can make the model less interpretable, as some \n",
