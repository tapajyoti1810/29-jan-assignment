    "  MongoDB is a popular document-based NoSQL database that is designed to be highly scalable and flexible. It is an \n",

    "4.Aggregation framework: MongoDB has a powerful aggregation framework that allows you to perform complex data processing \n",
    "on your collections.\n",
    "\n",
    "5.Ad hoc queries: MongoDB supports ad hoc queries, which means that you can query your data without having to define a\n",

    "6.Automatic sharding: MongoDB can automatically partition your data across multiple servers or nodes, which makes it easy\n",
