    "and predictor variables is linear, meaning that a change in the predictor variable corresponds to a proportional change in the\n",
    "response variable.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, let's say you want to predict a person's weight (dependent variable) based on their height (independent variable).\n",
    "You collect data on the height and weight of 50 people and fit a linear regression model. The model might look like this:\n",
    "\n",
    "Weight = 50 + 2.5 * Height\n",
    "\n",
    "This equation says that for every inch increase in height, a person's weight increases by 2.5 pounds on average.\n",
    "\n",
    "Logistic regression, on the other hand, is used to model the relationship between a binary dependent variable (also called the\n",
    "outcome variable) and one or more independent variables. The binary outcome variable can take one of two values, typically \n",
    "labeled as 0 and 1. The logistic regression model estimates the probability that the outcome variable will take the value 1 \n",
    "given the values of the predictor variables.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, let's say you want to predict whether a person will buy a product (outcome variable) based on their age \n",
    "(independent variable). You collect data on the age and buying behavior of 100 people and fit a logistic regression model. \n",
    "The model might look like this:\n",
    "\n",
    "Logit(P(buy)) = -2 + 0.05 * Age\n",
    "\n",
    "This equation says that the log odds of buying the product (represented by the left-hand side of the equation) is a linear \n",

    "exponentiating the log odds, and the probability can be calculated by dividing the odds by 1 + the odds.\n",
    "\n",
    "A scenario where logistic regression would be more appropriate than linear regression is when the outcome variable is binary \n",
    "or categorical. For example, logistic regression would be appropriate for predicting whether a customer will churn or not \n",
    "based on their demographic and behavioral characteristics. Another example is predicting whether a patient has a disease or \n",
    "not based on their symptoms and medical history. In both cases, the outcome variable is binary (churn or no churn, disease or\n",
    "no disease), making logistic regression a more suitable modeling approach than linear regression.\n"
