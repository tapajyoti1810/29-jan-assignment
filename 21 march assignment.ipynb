    " Ordinal encoding and label encoding are two commonly used methods for encoding categorical data.\n",
    "\n",
    "Ordinal encoding is a method of encoding categorical data where each unique value in the dataset is assigned a numerical value\n",
    "based on its rank or order. For example, if a dataset has the categorical variable \"education level\" with the categories \n",
    "\"high school\", \"some college\", and \"bachelor's degree\", ordinal encoding might assign the values 1, 2, and 3 respectively, \n",
    "based on their perceived rank.\n",
    "\n",
    "Label encoding, on the other hand, is a method of encoding categorical data where each unique value in the dataset is assigned\n",
    "a unique numerical value. For example, if a dataset has the categorical variable \"color\" with the categories \"red\", \"green\", \n",
    "and \"blue\", label encoding might assign the values 1, 2, and 3 respectively.\n",
    "\n",
    "When to choose one over the other depends on the specific characteristics of the dataset and the problem at hand. In general,\n",
    "ordinal encoding is preferred when there is a natural ordering to the categories and the numerical values assigned to them \n",
    "should reflect this order. For example, ordinal encoding might be appropriate for a dataset with the categorical variable \n",

    "\"medium\" is lower than \"high\".\n",
    "\n",
    "Label encoding, on the other hand, is preferred when there is no natural ordering to the categories and each category should\n",
    "be treated as distinct from the others. For example, label encoding might be appropriate for a dataset with the categorical\n",

    "Employment Status:\n",
